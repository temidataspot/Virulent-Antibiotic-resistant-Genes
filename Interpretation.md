# Interpretation
Interpretation of comparative analysis as seen [here](https://github.com/temidataspot/Virulent-Antibiotic-resistant-Genes/blob/main/Research%20Questions%20and%20Answers.md)

# Aeromonas hydrophila
Serine protease, haemolysin and lipase stand out with the highest values indicating that
these three genes likely play a major role in the bacterium’s virulence. They suggest a strong
capability to damage host cells, as these genes are involved in toxin production and tissue
breakdown.

Aerolysin are also relatively high suggesting moderate contribution to virulence
Elastase and nuclease show comparatively lower values (40), indicating they play smaller roles
in virulence compared to the other genes.

The resistance genes show much higher overall values compared to the virulence genes,
suggesting that Aeromonas hydrophila has a strong ability to resist antibiotics.
AMP_C, blaCTX_M, and bla_SHV are at or near 100, indicating the bacterium has a very
strong resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which are common in clinical treatment.

TET_A and INTERGERONS_CLASS_1 show strong resistance as well, with values around 80
and 60 respectively, suggesting the bacterium is also resistant to tetracyclines and possibly
affected by mobile genetic elements promoting antibiotic resistance.

TET_B (60) also contributes significantly to the resistance profile, but is not as prominent as
TET_A.
bla_TEM and SUL (both around 20) show lower levels of resistance, indicating they play
smaller roles in the bacterium's overall resistance to antibiotics.

# Aeromonas caviae
Serine protease stands out with the highest values indicating that it plays a major role in the
bacterium’s virulence.
Haemolysin, lipase, and nuclease suggests moderate contribution to virulence
Elastase and aerolysin show comparatively lower values, indicating they play smaller roles in
virulence compared to the other genes.

TET_A, AMP_C, blaCTX_M, and bla_SHV are at or near 100, indicating the bacterium has a
very strong resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which are common in clinical treatment.
TET_B shows mild resistance
bla_TEM, INTERGERONS_CLASS_1, and SUL show lower levels of resistance, indicating they
play smaller roles in the bacterium's overall resistance to antibiotics.

# Aeromonas veroni
Serine protease, haemolysin, Aerolysin, Elastase, nuclease and lipase suggests mild to
moderate virulence
AMP_C, blaCTX_M, TET_A, and bla_SHV are at or near 100, indicating the bacterium has a
very strong resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which are common in clinical treatment.
bla_TEM and TET_B show mild resistance

SUL shows lower levels of resistance, indicating they play smaller roles in the bacterium's
overall resistance to antibiotics.
INTERGERONS_CLASS_1 shows no resistance

# Aeromonas allosaccharophila
Serine protease, haemolysin, elastase, and nuclease shows mild to moderate virulence
Aerolysin and lipase shows no virulence

TET_A, AMP_C, blaCTX_M, and bla_SHV are at or near 100, indicating the bacterium has a
very strong resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which are common in clinical treatment.
TET_B and SUL shows mild resistance
INTERGERONS_CLASS_1 and bla-TEM shows no resistance.

# Aeromonas dhakensis
Serine protease, haemolysin, aerolysin, and nuclease suggests moderate virulence
Elastase and lipase show no virulence

TET_A, AMP_C, blaCTX_M, and bla_SHV are at a 100, indicating the bacterium has a very
strong resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which are common in clinical treatment.
TET_B, bla-TEM, SUL and INTERGERONS_CLASS_1 shows no resistance
