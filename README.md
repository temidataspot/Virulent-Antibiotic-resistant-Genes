## Overview
This  is a comparative analysis that compares virulent and antibiotic-resistant genes in five Aeromonas species.Â 
The virulent genes considered include Aerolysin, Elastase, Haemolysin, Lipase, Serine Protease, and Nuclease. 
The resistant genes considered include TET_A, TET_B, AMP_C, blaCTX-M, bla-SHV, bla-TEM, Interegerons Class 1, and SUL.

This data was cleaned and analysed using MS Excel and R studio
